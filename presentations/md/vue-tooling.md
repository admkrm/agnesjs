# Tooling

Tooling can greatly improve the development experience. We will look at single file components and the Vue command-line interface. In this chapter we learned about single file components (SFCs) and the Vue CLI. These two tools work together to create a more seamless development environment with access to more advanced techniques like transpiling and preprocessors.



## Single File components

### SFC structure

### Syntax highlighting





## Command-Line Interface

The Vue command-line interfaces, Vue CLI, allows us to use SFCs along with some other features that help with development. With the Vue CLI, we will be able to generate projects with vue create, prototypes with vue serve, and builds for production with vue build.

### Prerequisites

Once Node.js and NPM are installed, we will be able to install the Vue CLI.
Note if you prefer Yarn, https://yarnpkg.com, it can also be used to install the Vue Cli.

### Installing Vue CLI

npm install -g @vue/cli. Once that completes, you should see something similar to Figure 11-2 on a Mac or Linux machine or something like Figure 11-3 in Windows.

### Vue Create

### Vue Serve

### Project structure

#### Project Root

#### The src Folder

#### App.vue

#### Title.vue

### Rebuild and Serve

### Vue Build

### The CLI User Interface
